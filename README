wmal-python by z411 (electrik.persona@gmail.com)
===========
This is a experimental remake of the original wmal (written in Perl) to see which language may be better for the task. Currently wmal-python only can read lists and work with cache and queues, it still can't update episodes, or have alternative interfaces like the original wmal yet.

If you have suggestions about which language would be better for the project, please send me an e-mail.

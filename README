wMAL v0.1 Copyright (c) 2012 z411 (electrik.persona@gmail.com)
Distributed under the GNU General Public License v3, see COPYING for details.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
wMAL aims to be a lightweight and simple but feature-rich terminal-based
script for fetching, updating and using data from MyAnimeList anime lists.

The script logs into your MyAnimeList account, and lets you review your list,
search for shows, and update your episodes all directly from the terminal.
Aditionally it can search for a specified folder for the next episode
you have to watch and it starts your media player of choice automatically.
It also updates the episode automatically whenever the media player is closed.

SETUP
=====
For now there isn't an installer so for the first run you must copy
the file "wmal.conf.example" as "~/.wmal/wmal.conf" and edit it with
your own options.

USAGE
=====
Start the program by running it normally:

$ ./wmal.py

You will then enter in an interactive command line where you can run your
commands. You can type 'help' to see the available commands you can use,
and as in Bash you can press 'tab' to perform autocompletion and
up/down arrow keys for command history. To exit anytime type 'quit'
or enter an EOL (Ctrl+D).

You may also try the experimental curses and GTK interfaces.
$ ./wmal-curses.py
$ ./wmal-gtk.py

PROPOSED MODEL
==============
The project aims to be scalable as to support different clients and anime
databases in the future. Here's the expected design method (may change):

Client (CLI)    <-->                          <--> libmelative <-->
Client (curses) <--> Engine <--> Data Handler <--> libmal      <--> Internet (API)
Client (GTK)    <-->                  |       <--> libanidb    <-->
                                      v              etc...
                                   Local DB
